A Luanti mod. Adds cute companions you can go on adventures with. Brings more life to the world. (Heavily a work-in-progress)

To craft maid egg, use 4 bread. 3 on bottom, one in middle.

This is intended for decorative NPC's. Right click a maid to open the menu. You can set their home to a specific location and they will safely wander nearby. You can add a custom skin for them. The possibilities are endless.


Current features:

•Cute characters that make the world feel more alive.
•Home mode and Follow mode. They warp if too far, so no worries about them keeping up. Right click a maid to switch home/follow mode.
•You can replace the skin file to add a custom character.
•Maids are basically immortal. No worries about them dying!
•Choose between Big and Small height for a maid.

Limitations (This mod is a work in progress):

•Maids do not follow the player yet. They just wander. But they can teleport-follow when you are too far.
•No animations
•No functionality yet besides companionship.
•Thinner skins can work on maids, but may have slight visual issues. Full sized skins work best.


How to add skins: Put them in the textures folder in the mod. Make sure they're the same size; 64 by 32 pixels. If your skin is 64 by 64 (as many skins are), crop it to the correct size and keep the top part. See example skins in folder.

This mod is inspired by the Touhou Little Maid mod by TartaricAcid. Special thanks to TenPlus1, MirceaKitsune, Sdzen, Astrobe for their work used in this (See license).
